  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>  
  <p>Progressive enhancement is a philosophy which tries to provide a base structure of content to as many users as possible. This can be crusial for certain people who want to use a website because it effectivly lays out how you should make your website accessible to everyone. Everyone should have the right to accessing public websites, and progressive enhancement helps to wide the range of accessability.</p>
  <p>Progressive enhancement works by starting with a base structure of content and building from there. Firstly, you want to make the base of your code with HTML. Then, you can use css to enhance the experience of the code with designing your website, as well as making it more appealing for others. Lastly, you want to use JavaScript to make sure everything is running correctly and does not break. Having this type of structure is an easy method which can greatly increase accessability.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, everyone has the right to accessibility. Wether through dissability or not having the best software to run, certain things can be closed off and unavailable. Being able to build a website using progressive enhancement methods not only makes it easier for the coder, but it also makes it easier for the user. </p>

  <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
  <p>Over the semester, I enjoyed the projects because it allowed me to slowly become more sure of how to work through the coding. Doing all the different projects made me have to think and work through challenges which definetly helped me remeber what to do for the future.
  I would say for this project, I got really stuck on getting images to show up, and my mom(who reviewed my Dragon project) mentioned that as well. She also mentioned that it did not seem as clean, comparative to the real website for SpaceX. I think that has to do with not having some of the images, as well as the background design being more chaotic rather than more solid colors. I think I did well on spacing over the semester, but I got sloppy with the final project comparative to the css-demo.</p>
  <p>If I was able to start over, I would try to plan out how I would write the code, because I felt like I didn't know what I was doing in parts due to me skipping ahead. Being able to make a structured gameplan next time would really help in general. Overall, I really enjoyed learning about modifying images even though that was probably my worst area. As well as, learning Java script rather than just css.</p>
